# Spend it All

**Spend it All** is a 2D platformer made with **Godot 4.2.1** for the **Fuck Capitalism Game Jam**.

In this short but meaningful adventure, you collect coins across levels and face tempting opportunities to spend them on flashy but useless items. Every time you give in, the next level gets harder. Will you resist? Or will you pay the price?

## 🧠 Concept

A critique of **impulsive consumerism** in the form of a platformer. Players must decide whether to save their coins or spend them on things like:

- Sneakers (slower movement next level)
- Smartphone (annoying pop-up ads appear)
- Sunglasses (screen distortion effects)

Your choices affect gameplay and lead to one of three endings:
- **0 purchases** → Responsible: You resisted the system.
- **1 purchase** → Neutral: You could do better.
- **2 purchases** → Consumed: You fell for it.
